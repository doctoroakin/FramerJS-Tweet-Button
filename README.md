# FramerJS-Tweet-Button
FramerJS Prototype

I decided that I don't really like the "create a new tweet" functionality in the official Twitter app for Android.  I decided to put my own spin on it by creating an alternate Tweet Button using FramerJS.

Feel Free to use this as a starting point and to tweet me @jval3nti with any questions.  There are optional .png's to use in the images folder as well.
